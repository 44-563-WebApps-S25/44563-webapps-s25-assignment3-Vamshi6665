    <h2>Sambar Rice is my favourite food</h2>
    <p>Sambar Rice is my favourite dish because of its rich flavours, it is a fusion of variety of spices with <b>Dal</b> and <b>Basmati rice</b>. Its a combination of various spieces to give it a hot spicy flavour. The basmati rice addes more flavours to the dal and spices. It's one of the famous dishes of Hyderabad.</p>
